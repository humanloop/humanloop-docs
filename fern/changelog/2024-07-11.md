## Updated Code Evaluator runtime environment

We've made some improvements to our Code Evaluator runtime environment to support additional packages, environment variables, and runtime output.

### Runtime environment

When running a Code Evaluator we now return the stdout and stderr in the Debug Console, allowing an easier experience in developing your code. As well, environment variables can now be accessed from the os environments, such as `os.environ['HUMANLOOP_API_KEY']` or `os.environ['PROVIDER_KEYS']`.

### Python packages

Previously, the python packages we could support were limited but we can now support additional customer requested packages. Please reach out to discuss your usecase if you have specific needs.
