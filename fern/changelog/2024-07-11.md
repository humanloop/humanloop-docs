## Enhanced Code Evaluator Runtime Environment

We've introduced several enhancements to our Code Evaluator runtime environment to support additional packages, environment variables, and improved runtime output.

### Runtime Environment

Our Code Evaluator now returns both `stdout` and `stderr` in the Debug Console, making it easier to develop and troubleshoot your code. Additionally, environment variables can now be accessed via the `os.environ` dictionary, allowing you to retrieve values such as `os.environ['HUMANLOOP_API_KEY']` or `os.environ['PROVIDER_KEYS']`.

### Python Packages

Previously, the selection of Python packages we could support was limited. We are now able to accommodate additional customer-requested packages. If you have specific package requirements, please reach out to us to discuss your use case.
