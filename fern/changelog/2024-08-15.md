## Evaluate uncommitted versions

You can now evaluate versions without committing them first. This means you can draft a version of a Prompt in the editor and simultaneously evaluate it in the evaluations tab, speeding up your iteration cycle.

This is a global change that allows you to load and use uncommitted versions. Uncommitted versions are created automatically when a new version of a Prompt, Tool, or Evaluator is run in their respective editors or called via the API. These versions will now appear in the version pickers underneath all your committed versions.

To evaluate an uncommitted version, simply select it by using the hash (known as the "version id") when setting up your evaluation.
