## Evaluate uncommitted versions

You can now evaluate versions without committing them first. This means you can draft a version of a Prompt in the editor and simultaneously evaluate it in the evaluations tab, speeding up your iteration cycle.

This is a global change that allows you to load and use uncommitted versions. Uncommitted versions are created from every different version of a Prompt, Tool, or Evaluator that is either run in their respective editors or called via the API. These versions will appear in the version pickers underneath all the committed versions.

To evaluate an uncommitted version, simply select a version by using the hash (known as the "version id") of the version you want to evaluate.
