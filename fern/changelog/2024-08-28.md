## Search files by path

We've extended our search interface to include file paths, allowing you to more easily find and navigate to related files that you've grouped under a directory.

Bring up this search dialog by clicking "Search" near the top of the left-hand sidebar, or by pressing `Cmd+K`.

## Custom Metadata for Files

You can now include custom metadata to determine the unique version of your file definitions on Humanloop. This allows you to make the version depend on data custom to your application that Humanloop may not be aware of; such as feature flags or identifiers that indicate a different configuration of your system that may impact the behaviour of the Prompt or Tool.

Metadata can be submitted via the v5 API endpoints. When added, the metadata can been seen on each version in the Version Drawer.
