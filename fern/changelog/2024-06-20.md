## Claude 3.5 Sonnet support

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now in Humanloop!

Sonnet is the latest and most powerful model from Anthropic.

**2x the speed, 1/5th the cost, yet smarter than Claude 3 Opus.**

Anthropic have now enabled streaming of tool calls too, which is supported in Humanloop now too.

Add your Anthropic key and select Sonnet in the Editor to give it a go.
