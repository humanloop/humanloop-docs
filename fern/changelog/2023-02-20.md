## Faster datapoints table loading

Initial datapoints table is now twice as fast to load! And it will continue to get faster.

## Ability to open datapoint in playground

Added a way to go from the datapoint drawer to the playground with that datapoint loaded. Very convenient for trying tweaks to a model config or understanding an issue, without copy pasting.

## Markdown view and completed prompt templates

We’ve added a tab to the datapoint drawer so you can see the prompt template filled in with the inputs and output.

We’ve also button in the top right hand corner (or press `M`)  to toggle on/off viewing the text as markdown.
