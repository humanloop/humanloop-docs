## Introducing Flows

We've added a new key building block to our app with the first release of Flows. This release focuses on improving the code-first workflows for evaluating more complex AI applications like RAG and Agent-based apps.

Flows allow you to version your whole AI application on Humanloop (as opposed to just individual Prompts and Tools) and allows you to log and evaluate the full trace of the important processing steps that occur when running your app. 

See our [cookbook tutorial](https://github.com/humanloop/humanloop-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/rag/evaluate-rag-flow.ipynb) for examples on how to use Flows in your code.

### What's next

We'll soon be extending support for allowing Evaluators to access all Logs inside a trace. 
Additionally, we will build on this by adding UI-first visualisations and management of your Flows.

We'll sunset Sessions in favour of Flows in the near future. Reach out to us for guidance on how to migrate your Session-based workflows to Flows.
