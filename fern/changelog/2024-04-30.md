## Log drawer in Editor

You can now open up the Log drawer directly in the Editor.

This enables you to see exactly what was sent to the provider as well as the tokens used and cost. You can also conveniently add feedback and run evaluators on that specific Log, or add it to a dataset.

To show the Logs just click the arrow icon beside each generated message or completion.
