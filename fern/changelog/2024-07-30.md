## Select multiple Versions when creating an Evaluation

Our Evaluations feature allows you to benchmark Versions of a same File. We've made the form for creating new Evaluations simpler by allowing the selection of multiple in the picker dialog. Columns will be filled or inserted as needed.

As an added bonus, we've made adding and removing columns feel smoother with animations. The form will also scroll to newly-added columns.
