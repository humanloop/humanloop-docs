## Keyboard shortcuts and datapoint links

<img src="../assets/images/bd02cd0-ezgif-2-82ccc4e7f1.gif" />

Weâ€™ve added keyboard shortcuts to the datapoint viewer 

`g` for good  
`b` for bad

and `j` /` k` for next/prev

This should help you for quickly annotating data within your team.

You can also link to specific datapoint in the URL now as well.
