## Manage Directories via API

You can now manage directories directly using our API. This can be helpful for programmatically managing your workspace or dynamically creating folder structures. This is particularly useful for those needing to make bulk changes or automate certain directory tasks.

To learn more about directories on Humanloop you can checkout our [Directories](docs/concepts/directories) page.
