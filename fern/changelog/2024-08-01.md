## View the Standard Output of Your Code Evaluators

We've added the ability to see the Standard Output (Stdout) from your Code Evaluators. You can now use print statements within your code and view the outputs in your logs. Additionally, to help you iterate your code more quickly, the Stdout will also be visible in the Debug console.
