# Full Trace Evaluation for Flow Logs

- Evaluators can now assess entire Traces. When evaluating a Flow Log, the `trace_children` property is available on the `log`, providing information about all logs within the Trace. This property is accessible only for completed Traces and applies to all Logs within the Trace.
- This update supports both monitoring Evaluators and Evaluation Reports.
- This update impacts monitoring Evaluators. In the next release, we will support trace_children in Datasets created from Flow Logs and in Evaluations.
- Example: A target-free Evaluator that counts the number of logs in a Trace where `output` is `null`:

```python
def count_null_output_logs(log):
    """Count the number of logs in the Trace where output is null."""
    def count_null_output(log):
        """Helper function to recurse through the Trace."""
        null_count = 1 if log.get('output') is None else 0
        for child in log.get('trace_children', []):
            null_count += count_null_output(child)
        return null_count

    return count_null_output(log)
```
