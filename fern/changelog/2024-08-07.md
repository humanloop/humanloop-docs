## Additional Python Packages for Code Evaluators

We have expanded the packages available in the Evaluator Python environment. The new packages we've added are: `continuous-eval`, `jellyfish`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `spacy`, `transformers`.

We are actively improving our execution environment so if you have additional packages you'd like us to support, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
