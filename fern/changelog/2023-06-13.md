## Project Editor

We’ve introduced an Editor within each project to help you make it easier to to change prompts and bring in project specific data.

You can now also bring datapoints directly to the Editor. Select any datapoints you want to bring to Editor (also through `x` shortcut) and you can choose to open them in Editor (or `e` shortcut)

We think this workflow significantly improves the workflow to go from interesting datapoint to improved model config. As always, let us know if you have other feedback.
