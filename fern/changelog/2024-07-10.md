## Enhanced code Evaluators
We've introduced several enhancements to our code Evaluator runtime environment to support additional packages, environment variables, and improved runtime output.

### Runtime environment
Our Code Evaluator now logs both `stdout` and `stderr` when executed and environment variables can now be accessed via the `os.environ` dictionary, allowing you to retrieve values such as `os.environ['HUMANLOOP_API_KEY']` or `os.environ['PROVIDER_KEYS']`.

### Python packages
Previously, the selection of Python packages we could support was limited. We are now able to accommodate customer-requested packages. If you have specific package requirements for your eval workflows, please let us know!
