## Tool linking

It's now possible to manage tool definitions globally for your organization and re-use them across multiple projects by linking them to your model configs.

Prior to this change, if you wanted to re-use the same tool definition across multiple model configs, you had to copy and paste the JSON schema snippet defining the name, description and parameters into your Editor for each case. And if you wanted to make changes to this tool, you would have to recall which model configs it was saved to prior and update them inline 1 by 1.

You can achieve this tool re-use by first defining an instance of our new `JsonSchema` tool available as another option in your global `Tools` tab. Here you can define a tool once, such as `get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit')`, and then link that to as many model configs as you need within the Editor as shown below.

Importantly, updates to the `get_current_weather` `JsonSchema` tool defined here will then propagate automatically to all the model configs you've linked it to, without having to publish new versions of the prompt.

The old behaviour of defining the tool inline as part of your model config definition is still available for the cases where you do want changes in the definition of the tool to lead to new versions of the model-config.

## Set up the tool

Navigate to the [tools tab](https://app.humanloop.com/hl-test/tools) in your organisation and select the JsonSchema tool card.

With the dialog open, define your tool with `name`, `description`, and `parameters` values. Our guide for using [OpenAI Function Calling in the playground](/docs/guides/create-a-tool-in-the-editor) can be a useful reference in this case.

## Using the tool

In the editor of your target project, link the tool by pressing the `Add Tool` button and selecting your `get_current_weather` tool.
