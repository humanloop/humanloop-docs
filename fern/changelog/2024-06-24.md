## UX improvements to committing and deploying changes

We've made some improvements to the UX around committing and deploying changes to your evaluators, tools and datasets.

Now, each editor has a consistent and reliable loading and saving experience. You can choose prior versions in the dropdown, making it easier to toggle between versions.

Additionally, as you commit, you'll also get the option to immediately deploy your changes. This reduces the number of steps needed to get your changes live.

Additional bug fixes:

- Fixed the flickering issue on the datasets editor
- Fixed the issue where the evaluator editor would lose the state of the debug drawer on commit.
