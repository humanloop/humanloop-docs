## Manage Directories via API

You can now manage directories directly using our [API](https://humanloop.com/docs/api-reference/directories/create). This can be helpful for programmatically managing your workspace for bulk changes or dynamically creating folder structures.

To learn more about directories on Humanloop you can check out our [Directories](/docs/concepts/directories) page.
