## Get All Deployed Versions via API

We've introduced a new Files API in our v5 API resources that lets you query all files simultaneously. This is useful when managing your workflows on Humanloop and you wish to find all files that match specific criteria, such as having a deployment in a specific environment. Some of the supported filters to search with are file name, file type, and deployed environments. If you find there are additional access patterns you'd find useful, please reach out and let us know.
