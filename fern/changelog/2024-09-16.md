## Evaluation Names

You can now name your Evaluations in the UI and via the API. This is helpful for more easily identifying the purpose of your different Evaluations, especially when multiple teams are running different experiments.

In the API, pass in the `name` field when creating your Evaluation to set the name. Note that names must be unique for all Evaluations for a specific file. In the UI, navigate to your Evaluatio,n and you will see an option to rename it in the header.
