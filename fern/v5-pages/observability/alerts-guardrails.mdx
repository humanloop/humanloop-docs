Monitoring your AI system's performance in production is crucial for maintaining quality and catching issues early. Humanloop provides powerful tools to set up automated alerts based on your custom evaluation criteria. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up alerts using monitoring evaluators and webhooks.

## Overview of Alerting and Guardrails

Alerting and guardrails are essential components of a robust AI system, allowing you to monitor performance, detect anomalies, and maintain quality control in real-time. Here's an overview of what setting up alerting and guardrails can mean for your AI application:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up alerts to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, token usage, or model-specific metrics. This helps you ensure your system is operating within expected parameters.

2. **Quality Control**: Implement guardrails to automatically flag or filter outputs that don't meet certain quality thresholds. This can include content moderation, fact-checking, or adherence to specific guidelines.

3. **Anomaly Detection**: Configure alerts to notify you of unusual patterns or unexpected behaviors in your AI system, helping you identify and address issues quickly.

4. **Cost Management**: Set up alerts for usage thresholds to keep track of API calls, token consumption, and associated costs, preventing unexpected expenses.

5. **Compliance and Safety**: Establish guardrails to ensure your AI system's outputs comply with legal, ethical, and safety standards, reducing risks associated with AI-generated content.

6. **Feedback Loop**: Use alerts to trigger human review processes for edge cases or low-confidence outputs, facilitating continuous improvement of your AI system.

7. **Version Control**: Set up notifications for when new versions of your prompts or models are deployed, allowing you to monitor performance changes across versions.

8. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Configure webhooks to send alerts to your team's preferred communication channels or incident management systems, ensuring timely responses to critical issues.

By implementing a comprehensive alerting and guardrails system, you can maintain better control over your AI application, respond promptly to issues, and continuously improve its performance and reliability.
