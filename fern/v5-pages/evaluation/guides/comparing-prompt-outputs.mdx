## Compare outputs

Now that you have multiple versions of your prompt, you can compare their outputs:

1. In the prompt editor, click on the **Compare** tab.
2. Select the versions you want to compare from the dropdown menus.
3. Enter a test input in the provided field.
4. Click **Generate** to see the outputs from both versions side by side.
5. You can generate multiple outputs to compare the performance across different inputs.

## View Prompt diff

To see the exact differences between prompt versions:

1. While in the **Compare** tab, look for the **Diff** section.
2. This section will highlight the changes made between the selected versions, showing additions, deletions, and modifications.
3. Use this diff view to understand how specific changes in your prompt configuration affect the output.

By following these steps, you can effectively compare different versions of your prompts and iterate on your designs to improve performance.
