Humanloop is hosted on AWS in the US-east region by default. We are SOC-2 compliant and have a range of hosting options to meet your enterprise needs. We never train on your data.

Our menu of hosting options is as follows from basic to more advanced:

1. **Default**: Our multi-tenanted cloud offering is SOC2 compliant and hosted in AWS US-east region on AWS.
2. **Region specific**: Same as 1, but where additional region requirements for data storage are required - e.g. data can never leave the EU for GDPR reasons. We offer UK, EU and US guarantees for data storage regions.
3. **Dedicated**: We provision your own dedicated instance of Humanloop in your region of choice. With the additional added benefits:
    - Full [HIPAA compliant](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/) AWS setup.
    - Ability to manage your own encryption keys in KMS.
    - Ability to subscribe to application logging and cloudtrail infrastructure monitoring.
4. **Self-hosted**: You deploy an instance of Humanloop within your own VPC on AWS. We provide an infra as code setup with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) to easily spin up a Humanloop instance in your VPC.
