## User Authentication and Access Control

### Authentication & Access Control - Humanloop Web App

All users of the Humanloop web application require a valid email address and password to use the system:

- Email addresses are verified on account creation.
- Passwords are verified as sufficiently complex.
- Passwords are stored using a one-way salted hash.
- User access logs are maintained including date, time, user ID, relevant URL, operation performed, and source IP address for audit purposes.

### Authentication & Access Control - Humanloop API

All users of the API are required to authenticate with a unique API token header:

- Follows the OAuth 2.0 pattern.
- API tokens are only visible once on creation and then obfuscated.
- Users can manage the expiry of API keys.
- API token access logs are maintained including date, time, user ID, relevant URL, operation performed, and source IP address for audit purposes.

### Additional Resources

- Role-based access control (RBAC) - We implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) for all our systems.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - MFA is enforced for all employee accounts.

## Encryption Standards

### **Encryption**

Humanloop follows best practices for data management and encryption. All data in transit is secured with TLS/SSL, and all data at rest is encrypted using the AES-256 algorithm. All encryption keys are managed using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) as part of the VPC definition.

- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.

### **Infrastructure**

All sensitive data is encrypted in transit. For Self-Hosted Cloud (VPC) environments, network traffic is also encrypted in transit and at rest to meet HIPAA requirements. Sensitive application data is only ever processed within the ECS cluster and stored in Aurora. To request a network infrastructure diagram or more information, please contact [privacy@humanloop.com](mailto:privacy@humanloop.com).
