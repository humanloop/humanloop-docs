description: Directories can be used to group together related files. This is useful for organizing your work as part of prompt engineering and collaboration.

Directories in Humanloop serve as an organizational tool, allowing users to group related files and structure their work logically. They function similarly to folders in a traditional file system, providing a hierarchical structure for managing [prompts](/docs/concepts/prompts), [tools](/docs/concepts/tools), [datasets](/docs/concepts/datasets), and other resources.

Directories are primarily for organizational needs but they can have
functional impacts if you are referencing Prompts, Tools etc. by `path`.

We recommend to always refer to Prompts, Tools etc. by their `id` as this will
make your workflows more robust and avoid issues if the files are moved.
