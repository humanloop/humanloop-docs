## This guide will show you how to call your Prompts as an API, enabling you to generate responses from the large language model that uses the versioned template and parameters.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the new `prompt.call()` method, you need to have a Prompt. If you don't have one, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

<Markdown src="../../../snippets/setup-sdk.mdx" />

<Steps>

### Use the SDK to call your model

Now you can use the SDK to generate completions and log the results to your project using the new `prompt.call()` method:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts/call" />

<EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /prompts/call" />

### Navigate to the **Logs** tab of the Prompt

And you'll be able to see the recorded inputs, messages and responses of your chat.

</Steps>

ðŸŽ‰ Now that you have chat messages flowing through your project you can start to log your end user feedback to evaluate and improve your models.
