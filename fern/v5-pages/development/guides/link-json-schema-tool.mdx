It's possible to re-use tool definitions them across multiple Prompts. You achieve this by having a Prompt file which defines a JSON schema, and linking them to your Prompt.

You can achieve this by first defining an instance of a `JSON Schema` tool in your global Tools tab. Here you can define a tool once, such as `get_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit')`, and then link that to as many Prompts as you need within the Editor as shown below.

Importantly, updates to the `get_current_weather` `JSON Schema` tool defined here will then propagate automatically to all the Prompts you've linked it to, without having to publish new versions of the Prompt.

### Prerequisites

- A Humanloop account - you can create one by going to our sign up page.
- Be on a paid plan - your organization has been upgraded from the Free tier.
- You already have a Prompt â€” if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](/docs/guides/create-prompt) guide first.

To create a JSON Schema tool that can be reusable across your organization, follow the following steps:

## Creating and linking a JSON Schema Tool

<Markdown src="../../../snippets/paid-feature.mdx" />

<Steps>
### Create a Tool file

Click the 'New File' button on the homepage or in the sidebar.

### Select the **Json Schema** Tool type

### Define your tool

Set the `name`, `description`, and `parameters` values. Our guide for using [Tool Calling in the Prompt Editor](./tool-calling-editor) can be a useful reference in this case. We can use the `get_current_weather` schema in this case. Paste the following into the dialog:

```json
{
  "name": "get_current_weather",
  "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Location",
        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
      },
      "unit": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Unit",
        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
      }
    },
    "required": ["location"]
  }
}
```

### Press the **Create** button.

### Navigate to the **Editor**

Make sure you are using a model that supports tool calling, such as `gpt-4o`.

<Info title="Models supporting Tool calling">
  See the [Models page](/docs/v5/supported-models) for a list of models that
  support tool calling.
</Info>

### **Add Tool** to the Prompt definition.

### Select 'Link existing Tool'

In the dropdown, go to the **Link existing tool** option. You should see your `get_current_weather` tool, click on it to link it to your editor.

### Test that the Prompt is working with the tool

Now that your tool is linked you can start using it as you would normally use an inline tool. In the **Chat** section, in the **User** input, enter "What is the weather in london?"

Press the **Run** button.

You should see the **Assistant** respond with the tool response and a new **Tool** field inserted to allow you to insert an answer. In this case, put in `22` into the tool response and press **Run**.

The model will respond with `The current weather in London is 22 degrees`.

### Save the Prompt

You've linked a tool to your model config, now let's save it. Press the **Save** button and name your model config `weather-model-config`.

### (Optional) Update the Tool

Now that's we've linked your `get_current_weather` tool to your model config, let's try updating the base tool and see how it propagates the changes down into your saved `weather-model-config` config. Navigate back to the Tools in the sidebar and go to the Editor.

### Change the tool.

Let's update both the name, as well as the required fields. For the name, update it to `get_current_weather_updated` and for the required fields, add `unit` as a required field. The should look like this now:

```json
{
  "name": "get_current_weather_updated",
  "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Location",
        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
      },
      "unit": {
        "type": "string",
        "name": "Unit",
        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
      }
    },
    "required": ["location", "unit"]
  }
}
```

### Save the Tool

Press the **Save** button, then the following **Continue** button to confirm.

Your tool is now updated.

### Try the Prompt again

Navigate back to your previous project, and open the editor. You should see the `weather-model-config` loaded as the active config. You should also be able to see the name of your previously linked tool in the Tools section now says `get_current_weather_updated`.

In the Chat section enter in again, `What is the weather in london?`, and press **Run** again.

### Check the response

You should see the updated tool response, and how it now contains the `unit` field. Congratulations, you've successfully linked a JSON Schema tool to your model config.

<Warning title="Linked JSON Schema tool changes propagate to saved model configs">
  When updating your organization-level JSON Schema tools, remember that the
  change will affect all the places you've previously linked the tool. Be
  careful when making updates to not inadvertently change something you didn't
  intend.
</Warning>
