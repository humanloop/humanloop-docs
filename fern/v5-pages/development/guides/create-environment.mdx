[Environments](/docs/environments) are a tagging system for deploying Prompts. They enable you to deploy maintain a streamlined deployment workflow and keep track of different versions of Prompts.

The default environment is your production environment. Everytime you fetch a Prompt, Tool, Dataset etc. without specifying an alternative environment or specific version, the version that is tagged with the default environment is returned.

## Create an environment

<Steps>

### Go to your [Environments](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments) tab in your Organization's settings.

### Click the '**+ Environment**' button to open the new environment dialog

### Assign a custom name to the environment

We recommend something short. For example, you could use `staging`, `prod`, `qa`, `dev`, `testing`, etc. This name is be used to identify the environment in the UI and in the API.

### Click **Create**.

### Prerequisites

- You have multiple environments - if not first go through the [Create an
  environment](./deploy-to-an-environment) section.

Every organization will have a default environment. This can be updated by the following:

<Steps>

### Go to your Organization's [Environments](https://app.humanloop.com/account/environments) page.

### Click on the dropdown menu of an environment that is not already the default.

### Click the **Make default** option

A dialog will open asking you if you are certain this is a change you want to make. If so, click the **Make default** button.

### Verify the default tag has moved to the environment you selected.
