Datasets are pre-defined collections of input-output pairs that you can use within Humanloop to define fixed examples for your projects.

A datapoint consists of three things:

- **Inputs**: a collection of prompt variable values which are interpolated into the prompt template of your model config at generation time (i.e. they replace the `{{ variables }}` you define in the prompt template.
- **Messages**: for chat models, as well as the prompt template, you may have a history of prior chat messages from the same conversation forming part of the input to the next generation. Datapoints can have these messages included as part of the input.
- **Target**: data representing the expected or intended output of the model. In the simplest case, this can simply be a string representing the exact output you hope the model produces for the example represented by the datapoint. In more complex cases, you can define an arbitrary JSON object for `target` with whatever fields are necessary to help you specify the intended behaviour. You can then use our [evaluations](./evaluate-your-model)feature to run the necessary code to compare the actual generated output with your `target` data to determine whether the result was as expected.

Datasets can be created via CSV upload, converting from existing Logs in your project, or by API requests.
