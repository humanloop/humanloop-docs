subtitle: Datasets can be created from existing logs or uploaded from CSV and via the API.
---

You can currently create datasets in Humanloop in three ways: from existing **logs**, by uploading a **CSV** or via the **API**.

## Convert from existing logs

Prerequisites:

- A [Prompt](./prompts) in Humanloop
- Some [Logs](./generate-and-log-with-the-sdk) available in that Prompt

To create a dataset from existing Logs:

<Steps>

### Go to the **Logs** tab

### Select a subset of the Logs

### Choose **Add to dataset**

In the menu in the top right of the page, select **Add to dataset**.

### Add to a new or existing Dataset

Provide a name of the new dataset and click **Create**, or you can click **add to existing dataset** to append the selected to a dataset you already have.

</Steps>

## Upload from CSV

Prerequisites:

- A [Prompt](../prompts) in Humanloop

To create a dataset from a CSV file, we'll first create a CSV in Google Sheets and then upload it to a dataset in Humanloop.

<Steps>
### Create a CSV file. 
   - In our Google Sheets example below, we have a column called `user_query` which is an input to a prompt variable of that name. So in our model config, we'll need to include `{{ user_query }}` somewhere, and that placeholder will be populated with the value from the `user_query` input in the datapoint at generation-time.
   - You can include as many columns of prompt variables as you need for your model configs.
   - There is additionally a column called `target` which will populate the target of the datapoint. In this case, we use simple strings to define the target.
   - Note: `messages` are harder to incorporate into a CSV file as they tend to be verbose and hard-to-read JSON. If you want a dataset with messages, consider using the API to upload, or convert from existing logs.

### Export the Google Sheet to CSV by choosing **File** → **Download** → **Comma-separated values (.csv)**

### In your Humanloop project, go to the **Datasets** tab and choose **New dataset**

### In the dialog window, provide a name and optional description for the dataset. Then upload the CSV file from step 2 by drag-and-drop or using the file explorer.

### Click **Upload Dataset from CSV** and you should see a new dataset appear in the datasets tab. You can explore it by clicking in.

### Follow the link in the pop-up to inspect the dataset that was created in the upload. You'll see a column with the input key-value pairs for each datapoint, a messages column (in our case we didn't use messages, so they're all empty) and a target column with the expected model output.

## Upload via API

<Steps>
### First define some sample data as a basis for your test datapoints, consisting of user messages and target extraction pairs. This is where you could load up any existing data you wish to use for your evaluation:

```python Python
# Example test case data
data = [
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hi Humanloop support team, I'm having trouble understanding how to use the evaluations feature in your software. Can you provide a step-by-step guide or any resources to help me get started?",
            }
        ],
        "target": {"feature": "evaluations", "issue": "needs step-by-step guide"},
    },
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hi there, I'm interested in fine-tuning a language model using your software. Can you explain the process and provide any best practices or guidelines?",
            }
        ],
        "target": {
            "feature": "fine-tuning",
            "issue": "process explanation and best practices",
        },
    },
]
```

### Then define a dataset and upload the datapoints

```python Python
# Create a dataset
dataset = humanloop.datasets.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    name="Sample dataset",
    description="Examples of featue requests extracted from user messages",
)
dataset_id = dataset.body["id"]

# Create datapoints for the dataset
datapoints = humanloop.datasets.create_datapoint(
    dataset_id=dataset_id,
    body=data,
)
```

</Steps>

On the datasets tab in your Humanloop project you will now see the dataset you just uploaded via the API.
