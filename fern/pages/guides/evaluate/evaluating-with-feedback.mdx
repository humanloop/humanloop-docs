subtitle: This guide demonstrates how to run a batch generation and collect manual human feedback.
---

### Prerequisites

- You need to have access to evaluations.
- You also need to have a Prompt â€“ if not, please follow our [Prompt creation](./create-prompt) guide.
- Finally, you need at least a few logs in your project. Use the **Editor** to generate some logs if you don't have any yet.

### Set up an evaluator to collect human feedback

<Steps>

### Create a 'Human' Evaluator

From the Evaluations page, click **New Evaluator** and select **Human**.

### View the details

As the rows populate with the generated output from the model, you can review those outputs and apply feedback in the rating column. Click a row to see the full details of the Log in a drawer.

### Apply your feedback either directly in the table, or from the drawer.

### Once you've finished providing feedback for all the Logs in the run, click **Mark as complete** in the top right of the page.

### You can review the aggregated feedback results in the **Stats** section on this page.

</Steps>

## Configuring the feedback schema

If you need a more complex feedback schema, visit the **Settings** page in your project and follow the link to **Feedbacks**. Here, you can add more categories to the default feedback types. If you need more control over feedback types, you can [create new ones via the API](/api-reference/projects/createfeedbacktype).
