subtitle: How to set up a project in Humanloop using the Python SDK.
---

The Humanloop Python SDK allows you to programmatically set up Humanloop projects with [model configs](./key-concepts#model-config) and a [feedback schema](./key-concepts#feedback).

## Prerequisites

1. A Humanloop account. If you don't have one, you can create an account now by going to the [Sign up page](https://app.humanloop.com/signup).

## Install and Initialize the SDK

First you need to install and initialize the SDK. If you have already done this, skip to the next section. Otherwise, open up your terminal and follow these steps:

1. Install the Humanloop Python SDK:
   ```shell
   pip install humanloop
   ```
2. Start a Python interpreter:
   ```shell
   python
   ```
3. Initialize the SDK with your Humanloop API key (get your API key from your [Organisation Settings page](https://app.humanloop.com/account/api-keys))
   ```python
   from humanloop import Humanloop
   humanloop = Humanloop(api_key="<YOUR Humanloop API KEY>")
   ```

## Create a project

Continue in the same Python interpreter (where you have run `humanloop = Humanloop(...)`).

1. Create the project

   ```python
   project_response = humanloop.projects.create(name="{{your-organization}}-sdk-tutorial")
   project_id = project_response.body["id"]
   ```

2. Add your own feedback types and values  
   By default your project has a feedback type `rating` with labels `good` and `bad`.
   ```python
   humanloop.projects.update_feedback_types(
       id=project_id,
       body=[{
           "type": "action",
           "class": "multi_select",
           "values": [
             {"value": "copied"}, {"value": "saved"}
           ],
       }]
   )
   ```
3. Register your model config
   ```python
   humanloop.model_configs.register(
       project="{{your-organization}}-sdk-tutorial",
       model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
       prompt_template="Write a snappy introduction about {{topic}}:",
       temperature=0.8,
   )
   ```

You now have a project in Humanloop that contains your model config with feedback types set up.  
You can view your project and invite team members by going to the **Project** page.

With the project now set up, you can start to log generations from your models by following the [guide to logging generations using the SDK](./generate-and-log-with-the-sdk).
