A [Prompt](./prompts) defines how a large language model behaves.

You should create a new Prompt for each task done by the large language model (LLM).

For example, if you have a task of ‘generate google ad copy’, that should be a Prompt. If you have a summarization that works on top of tweets, that should be a project. You should have many separate projects for each of your tasks on top of the LLM.

You can create a Prompt [via the UI](./create-a-prompt-in-the-ui) or [via the SDK/API](./create-a-prompt-with-the-sdk).

  Note that we use a capitalized "[Prompt](./prompts)" to refer to the entity in
  Humanloop, and a lowercase "prompt" to refer to the general concept of input
  to the model.
