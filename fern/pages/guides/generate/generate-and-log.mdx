subtitle: Use Humanloop to generate from large language models
---

A **Log** is a generation from a large language model. It contains the inputs and the output as well as metadata such as which version was used and any associated feedback.

There are two ways to create a Log:

- **[Generate](./generate)**: Use the Humanloop UI to generate text from a large language model.
- **[Log](./log)**: Use the Humanloop API to create a Log from a large language model.

The guides in this section instruct you on how to create Logs on Humanloop. Once this is setup, you can begin to use Humanloop to evaluate and improve your LLM apps.
