**Admin:** The highest level of control. They can manage, modify, and oversee the organization's settings and have full functionality across all projects.

**Developer:** (Enterprise tier only) Can deploy prompts, manage environments, create and add API keys, but lacks the ability to access billing or invite others.

**Member:** (Enterprise tier only) The basic level of access. Can create and save prompts, run evaluations, but not deploy. Can not see any org-wide API keys.
