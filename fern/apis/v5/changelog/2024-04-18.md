## Anthropic tool support (Beta)

Our Editor and deployed endpoints now supports tool use with the Anthropic's Claude3 models. Tool calling with Anthropic is still in Beta, so streaming is not important.

In order to user tool calling for Claude in Editor you therefore need to first turn off streaming mode in the menu dropdown to the right of the load button.
