The Humanloop API allows you to interact with Humanloop from your product or service.

You can do this through HTTP requests from any language or via our official Python or TypeScript SDK.

```bash
pip install humanloop
```

To install the official [TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanloop), run the following command:
