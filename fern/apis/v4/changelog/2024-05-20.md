## Improved Logs Filtering

We've improved the ability to filter logs by time ranges. The API logs filter parameters for `start_date` and `end_date` now supports querying with more granularity. Previously the filters were limited to dates, such as **2024-05-22**, now you can use hourly ranges as well, such as **2024-05-22 13:45**.

For more detail, please see the [API documentation](https://docs.humanloop.com/reference/logs_list) on our Logs endpoints.
