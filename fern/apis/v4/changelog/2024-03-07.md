## Improved navigation & sidebar

We've introduced a sidebar for easier navigation between your Prompts and Tools. 

As new language models unlock more complex use cases, you'll be setting up and connecting Prompts, Tools, and Evaluators. The new layout better reflects these emerging patterns, and switching between your files is now seamless with the directory tree in the sidebar.

You can also bring up the search dialog with **Cmd+K** and switch to another file using only your keyboard.
