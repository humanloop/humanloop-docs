## Chain LLM calls

We've introduced sessions to Humanloop, allowing you to link multiple calls together when building a chain or agent.

Using sessions with your LLM calls helps you troubleshoot and improve your chains and agents.

### Adding a datapoint to a session

To log your LLM calls to a session, you just need to define a unique identifier for the session and pass it into your Humanloop calls with `session_reference_id`.

For example, using `uuid4()` to generate this ID,

```python
import uuid
session_reference_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

response = humanloop.complete(
    project="sessions_example_assistant",
    model_config={
        "prompt_template": "Question: {{user_request}}\nGoogle result: {{google_answer}}\nAnswer:\n",
        "model": "text-davinci-002",
        "temperature": 0,
    },
    inputs={"user_request": user_request, "google_answer": google_answer},
    session_reference_id=session_reference_id,
)
```

Similarly, our other methods such as `humanloop.complete_deployed()`, `humanloop.chat()`, and `humanloop.log()` etc. support `session_reference_id`.

If you're using our API directly, you can pass `session_reference_id` within the request body in your `POST /v4/completion` etc. endpoints.
